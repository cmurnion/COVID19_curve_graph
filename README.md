# COVID19_curve_graph
Requires matplotlib to run.

The script needs to be in the same directory as the csv files, like so: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports

To change which countries/states display, edit main() with names and population numbers.
